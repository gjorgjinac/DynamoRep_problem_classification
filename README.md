# DynamoRep_problem_classification
Code base for the "DynamoRep: Trajectory-Based Population Dynamics for Classification of Black-box Optimization Problems" paper
The algorithms are run using the `run_algorithms.py` script. This generates trajectory data for the DE, GA, CMA-ES and ES algorithms. The full algorithm data will be published on Zenodo, after the double blind review process is done, since Zenodo requires author information to be revealed.
The `problem_classification.py` then reads the trajectory data generated by the algorithms, calculates the DynamoRep features and performs problem classification.

The `trajectory_ELA.R` script generates the trajectory-based ELA features. 
The `problem_classification_ELA_same_features.py` script then performs the problem classification using the ELA features which contain useful values(do not have a constant or NAN value). 
We used this only for comparison of the proposed DynamoRep features.

The notebooks are used only for analysis of the results and generating the figures presented in the paper.
